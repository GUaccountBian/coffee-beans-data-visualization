        Imagine yourself standing in a coffee shop, surrounded by an endless array of coffee beans from all over the
        world.
        With so many choices, you feel a sense of overwhelm as you try to make a decision. In a moment of spontaneity,
        you randomly choose a bag of coffee beans from Hawaii. As you hold the bag in your hand,
        you begin to wonder about the origins of this coffee bean.
        Does Hawaii produce coffee beans? And if so, how many do they produce?
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, the innovative plots in front of you provide all the answers you need. You can use the slider to
        play around the plots to see production of coffee across different continents
        and countries over several decades. Moreover, you can click on the button to see different continents and at the mean time,
        you can still use slider. Don't forget they are interactive!

        <b>Figure 1 & Figure 2</b>: Interactive plots showcasing coffee production across different continents and
        countries over several decades. The choropleth map highlights the dominance of Brazil in global coffee
        production.
        The line plots provide a more detailed view of production trends for specific regions,
        highlighting the complexities of coffee production across different continents.
      </figcaption>
      <p>
        One striking finding from the choropleth map is the dominance of Brazil in global coffee production. The map
        highlights how Brazil's coffee production has steadily grown over the years, and how it now accounts for a
        significant proportion of the world's coffee supply. Moreover, the map also shows the emergence of other
        countries such as Vietnam, which has risen to become the second-largest coffee producer in the world. By
        providing a visual representation of coffee production at a global level, these visualizations underscore the
        significance
        of these countries in meeting the world's demand for coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        The line plots provide additional insights into coffee production at a more granular level. By allowing viewers
        to explore production trends for specific countries and continents over time, these plots highlight the
        complexities of coffee production and how it varies across different regions. For instance, the line plot for
        Asia reveals that coffee production in this region has remained relatively flat over the years, while the line
        plot for Africa
        shows a more erratic trend with periods of rapid growth followed by declines in production. Europe has produced
        very
        few coffee beans because most European coffee beans are importedã€‚ Overall, the interactive plots demonstrate the
        importance of coffee as a global commodity and highlight the key players in the coffee production industry. By
        enabling viewers to explore coffee production data in an engaging and interactive way, these visualizations
        provide valuable insights into the forces that shape coffee production and consumption around the world.

        We learned about the amount of coffee beans produced around the world. Millions of people enjoying it daily.
        However, the flavor of coffee can vary widely depending on where it's grown and how it's roasted.
        Sometimes, you may find some coffees too acidic or too dark.

      <h2>A Flavor Expedition: Delving into the Coffee Tasting Profiles of Leading Countries</h2>
      <p>
        As you take a closer look at the bag of coffee beans, you wonder what it will taste like. Will it be too acidic
        or too dark?
        Once again, the interactive bubble plot comes to your rescue. The size of each bubble represents the average
        rating of each coffee bean,
        and when you click on a bubble, you are presented with a radar plot showing its flavor attributes. Now you know
        exactly what you're in for.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the complexity of coffee flavor profiles, we turned to data
        from a global coffee tasting competition. By analyzing this data, we
        were able to identify the countries that produce the highest-rated
        coffees, as well as the flavor attributes that make them stand out.
        Our interactive bubble plot shows the top coffee-producing countries,
        with the size of the bubbles representing average rating of their
        coffees. We can see that Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya are the
        highest-rated coffee producers.

        To further understand what makes these coffees stand out, we used a
        radar plot to visualize their flavor attributes, such as acidity,
        sweetness, and body. We can see that Ethiopian coffees have high
        acidity, while Colombian coffees have a balanced flavor profile with
        moderate levels of all attributes. Now, if you like acidic, you know what country of coffee bean you need to
        buy.
        If you are a first time coffee drinker, I suggest you drink coffee made from Colombian coffee beans. You can't
        go wrong that way.
        By combining these visualizations,we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity of coffee flavor
        and the important role that geography plays in shaping it.
