      The interactive plots above showcase the production of coffee across different continents and countries over a
      span of several decades. While coffee is grown in various parts of the world, these visualizations reveal that
      certain regions have emerged as leaders in coffee production.

      One striking finding from the choropleth map is the dominance of Brazil in global coffee production. The map
      highlights how Brazil's coffee production has steadily grown over the years, and how it now accounts for a
      significant proportion of the world's coffee supply. Moreover, the map also shows the emergence of other
      countries
      such as Vietnam, which has risen to become the second-largest coffee producer in the world. By providing a
      visual
      representation of coffee production at a global level, these visualizations underscore the significance of these
      countries in meeting the world's demand for coffee.

      The line plots provide additional insights into coffee production at a more granular level. By allowing viewers
      to
      explore production trends for specific countries and continents over time, these plots highlight the
      complexities
      of coffee production and how it varies across different regions. For instance, the line plot for Africa reveals
      that coffee production in this region has remained relatively flat over the years, while the line plot for Asia
      shows a more erratic trend with periods of rapid growth followed by declines in production.

      Overall, the interactive plots demonstrate the importance of coffee as a global commodity and highlight the key
      players in the coffee production industry. By enabling viewers to explore coffee production data in an engaging
      and interactive way, these visualizations provide valuable insights into the forces that shape coffee production
      and consumption around the world.

      <p>
        Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world, with millions
        of people enjoying it daily. However, the flavor of coffee can vary
        widely depending on where it's grown and how it's roasted. To
        understand the complexity of coffee flavor profiles, we turned to data
        from a global coffee tasting competition. By analyzing this data, we
        were able to identify the countries that produce the highest-rated
        coffees, as well as the flavor attributes that make them stand out.
        Our interactive bubble plot shows the top coffee-producing countries,
        with the size of the bubbles representing average rating of their
        coffees. We can see that Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya are the
        highest-rated coffee producers.
      </p>

      <p>
        To further understand what makes these coffees stand out, we used a
        radar plot to visualize their flavor attributes, such as acidity,
        sweetness, and body. We can see that Ethiopian coffees have high
        acidity, while Colombian coffees have a balanced flavor profile with
        moderate levels of all attributes. By combining these visualizations,
        we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity of coffee flavor
        and the important role that geography plays in shaping it.
