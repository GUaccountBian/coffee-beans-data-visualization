        <b>Figure 1 & Figure 2</b>: Interactive plots showcasing coffee production across different continents and
        countries over several decades. The choropleth map highlights the dominance of Brazil in global coffee production.
        The line plots provide a more detailed view of production trends for specific regions,
        highlighting the complexities of coffee production across different continents.

      <p>
        The interactive plots above showcase the production of coffee across different continents and countries over a
        span of several decades. While coffee is grown in various parts of the world, these visualizations reveal that
        certain regions have emerged as leaders in coffee production.
  
        One striking finding from the choropleth map is the dominance of Brazil in global coffee production. The map
        highlights how Brazil's coffee production has steadily grown over the years, and how it now accounts for a
        significant proportion of the world's coffee supply. Moreover, the map also shows the emergence of other
        countries such as Vietnam, which has risen to become the second-largest coffee producer in the world. By providing a
        visual representation of coffee production at a global level, these visualizations underscore the significance of these
        countries in meeting the world's demand for coffee.
  
        The line plots provide additional insights into coffee production at a more granular level. By allowing viewers
        to explore production trends for specific countries and continents over time, these plots highlight the
        complexities of coffee production and how it varies across different regions. For instance, the line plot for Asia reveals that
        coffee production in this region has remained relatively flat over the years, while the line plot for Africa shows
        a more erratic trend with periods of rapid growth followed by declines in production. Europe has produced very few
        coffee beans because most European coffee beans are imported。 Overall, the interactive plots demonstrate the
        importance of coffee as a global commodity and highlight the key players in the coffee production industry. By
        enabling viewers to explore coffee production data in an engaging and interactive way, these visualizations
        provide valuable insights into the forces that shape coffee production and consumption around the world.

      <p>
        We learned about the amount of coffee beans produced around the world. Millions of people enjoying it daily. 
        However, the flavor of coffee can vary widely depending on where it's grown and how it's roasted. 
        Sometimes, you may find some coffees too acidic or too dark.

      <p>       
        To understand the complexity of coffee flavor profiles, we turned to data
        from a global coffee tasting competition. By analyzing this data, we
        were able to identify the countries that produce the highest-rated
        coffees, as well as the flavor attributes that make them stand out.
        Our interactive bubble plot shows the top coffee-producing countries,
        with the size of the bubbles representing average rating of their
        coffees. We can see that Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya are the
        highest-rated coffee producers.
      </p>

      <p>
        To further understand what makes these coffees stand out, we used a
        radar plot to visualize their flavor attributes, such as acidity,
        sweetness, and body. We can see that Ethiopian coffees have high
        acidity, while Colombian coffees have a balanced flavor profile with
        moderate levels of all attributes. Now, if you like acidic, you know what country of coffee bean you need to buy.
        If you are a first time coffee drinker, I suggest you drink coffee made from Colombian coffee beans. You can't go wrong that way.
        By combining these visualizations,we can gain a deeper appreciation for the complexity of coffee flavor
        and the important role that geography plays in shaping it.
