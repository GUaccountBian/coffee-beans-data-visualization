                </p>

                <p style="text-align:left">For Figure 1, the choropleth map is a visually striking representation of the geographic distribution of coffee
                production across continets and years. Expertly crafted using the Plotly library in Python, it employs a captivating color scheme corresponding to the 
                theme, with each hue carefully chosen to signify different production levels. This allows users to instantly grasp the underlying trends and geographic
                variations. Interactive elements, such as sliders and buttons, empower users to deleve into the data on their terms, selecting differrent years or focusing
                on a specific continent, providing a tailored and engaging experience. 
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:left">For Figure 2, the line chart unravels the story of coffee production over time. It highlights the nuances of each continent's 
                production level for each year. The synergy of lines and marks creates a visually engaging narrative, succinctly capturing the evolution of production
                across years. Designed with the user in mind, the line chart offers an accessible and captivating insight into the historical trends of coffee production.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:left">Both the choropleth map and line chart work in harmony to weave an engrossing tale that unveils the captivating world of 
                coffee bean production. By mergin these two powerful visualizations, this plot provides users with an immersive and interactive exploration of the 
                complex and intriguing domain of cofee production.</p>

                </p>

                <p style="text-align:left">For <i>Figure 3</i>, it reates an interactive bubble chart to display information about different countries' coffee quality based on their total cup points. The chart is created using the D3.js library, which allows the visualization of data in a dynamic and interactive way.
                    The bubble chart shows different countries as circles (or "bubbles") of different sizes, representing their total number of cups. The background image of each bubble is their national flag. By hovering the mouse over each bubble, the chart shows information about the country's ID and total cup points.
                    The chart also includes a drag-and-drop feature that allows users to interactively reposition the bubbles. The bubbles move according to the force simulation, which applies forces such as attraction towards the x and y axes, and collision avoidance between bubbles. </p>
                <p style="text-align:left">For <i>Figure 4</i>, it is a radar plot using the Plotly library in Python. The plot displays data for different categories (Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity and Cup Cleanliness) for a given country.
                    The input to the function is a dataframe (a table of data) and a value k that specifies which row in the dataframe to use for the plot.
                    The radar plot is then created using the go.Scatterpolar function from Plotly. The function sets the values for the radar plot, including the data to be plotted, the colors, and the labels.
                    The layout of the radar plot is set using the update_layout function. This function sets the polar coordinates, including the ranges and labels for the radial and angular axes. It also sets the background color and title of the plot.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left"> Users can also click on a bubble to access a more detailed analysis of the country's coffee quality through a Plotly plot. The plot is loaded into an iframe element and displayed in a separate container within the webpage.
                    The Linked plots shows an interactive bubble chart that provides an engaging and informative way to explore and compare different countries' coffee quality based on their total cup points. It allows users to gain insights into the data and access further details on specific countries through Plotly plots.</p>

                <p style="text-align:left">For Figure 5, it creates an interactive chord diagram to visualizerelationships between different countries and 
                coffee varieties based on their total coffee bean reviews. The diagram is constructed using the D3.js library, enabling dynamic and interactive
                data visualization.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left">The data is parsed, and unique countries and varieties are extracted. A matrix is initialized and filled with the number
                of occurrences of a country-variety pair. The "createChordDiagram" function is called with the populated matrix and the combined list of countries
                andvarieties as labels. In this function, dimensions and radius for the diagram are set. The chord layout is established with specified padding and
                sorting. A color scale is also created to visually distinguish data categories.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left">An SVG container is appended to the webpage, and outer arcs representing countries and varieties are drawn. Interactive 
                features are added in the diagram, such as highlighting related chords and arcs on mouseover events. Labels are also attached to the arcs for easy
                identification.</p>
                <p style="text-align:left">The inner chordsm signifying the relationships between countries and varieties, are drawn with the D3 ribbon generator.
                These chords respond to mouseover events by highlighting the selected chord and dimming unrelated chords, allowing uers to focues on the 
                relationship of interest.</p>
