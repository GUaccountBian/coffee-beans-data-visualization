        <p class="lead">Figure 1 & Figure 2 (Linked plot)
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left">For Figure 1, the choropleth map is a visually striking representation of the
          geographic distribution of coffee
          production across continets and years. Expertly crafted using the Plotly library in Python, it employs a
          captivating color scheme corresponding to the
          theme, with each hue carefully chosen to signify different production levels. This allows users to instantly
          grasp the underlying trends and geographic
          variations. Interactive elements, such as sliders and buttons, empower users to deleve into the data on their
          terms, selecting differrent years or focusing
          on a specific continent, providing a tailored and engaging experience.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">For Figure 2, the line chart unravels the story of coffee production over time. It
          highlights the nuances of each country's
          production level for each year. The synergy of lines and marks creates a visually engaging narrative,
          succinctly capturing the evolution of production
          across years. Designed with the user in mind, the line chart offers an accessible and captivating insight into
          the historical trends of coffee production.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">Overall, the linked plot with a map and line is an innovative way to visualize
          complex data sets that involve both spatial and temporal dimensions. By mergin these two powerful
          visualizations, this plot provides users with an
          immersive and interactive exploration of the
          complex and intriguing domain of cofee production.</p>

        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left">For <i>Figure 3</i>, it reates an interactive bubble chart to display information
          about different countries' coffee quality based on their total cup points. The chart is created using the
          D3.js library, which allows the visualization of data in a dynamic and interactive way.
          The bubble chart shows different countries as circles (or "bubbles") of different sizes, representing their
          total number of cups. The background image of each bubble is their national flag. By hovering the mouse over
          each bubble, the chart shows information about the country's ID and total cup points.
          The chart also includes a drag-and-drop feature that allows users to interactively reposition the bubbles. The
          bubbles move according to the force simulation, which applies forces such as attraction towards the x and y
          axes, and collision avoidance between bubbles. </p>
        <p style="text-align:left">For <i>Figure 4</i>, it is a radar plot using the Plotly library in Python. The plot
          displays data for different categories (Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity and Cup
          Cleanliness) for a given country.
          The input to the function is a dataframe (a table of data) and a value k that specifies which row in the
          dataframe to use for the plot.
          The radar plot is then created using the go.Scatterpolar function from Plotly. The function sets the values
          for the radar plot, including the data to be plotted, the colors, and the labels.
          The layout of the radar plot is set using the update_layout function. This function sets the polar
          coordinates, including the ranges and labels for the radial and angular axes. It also sets the background
          color and title of the plot.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left"> Users can also click on a bubble to access a more detailed analysis of the
          country's coffee quality through a Plotly plot. The plot is loaded into an iframe element and displayed in a
          separate container within the webpage.
          The Linked plots shows an interactive bubble chart that provides an engaging and informative way to explore
          and compare different countries' coffee quality based on their total cup points. It allows users to gain
          insights into the data and access further details on specific countries through Plotly plots.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left">
          By linking the bubble and radar charts, it becomes possible to compare and contrast multiple variables across
          different categories or groups. This allows for a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables
          and can provide insights into trends and patterns that might not be apparent in other types of visualizations.

        <p class="lead">Figure 5
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:left">For Figure 5, it creates an interactive sankey diagram to visualizerelationships
          between different countries and
          coffee varieties based on their total coffee bean reviews. The diagram is constructed using the D3.js library,
          enabling dynamic and interactive
          data visualization.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">The data is parsed, and unique countries and varieties are extracted. A matrix is
          initialized and filled with the number
          of occurrences of a country-variety pair. The "createSankeyDiagram" function is called with the populated
          matrix and the combined list of countries
          andvarieties as labels. In this function, dimensions and radius for the diagram are set. The sankey layout is
          established with specified padding and
          sorting. A color scale is also created to visually distinguish data categories.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">An SVG container is appended to the webpage, and outer arcs representing countries
          and varieties are drawn. Interactive features are added in the diagram, such as highlighting related Sankey
          and arcs on mouseover events.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left">The inner link representing the relationships between countries and varieties is
          drawn with the D3 link generator. These Sankey respond to mouseover events by highlighting the selected
          Sankey and dimming unrelated Sankey, allowing users to focus on the relationship of interest. Overall, this
          creates a dynamic and interactive data visualization that enables easy exploration and understanding of the
          coffee bean reviews data.</p>
